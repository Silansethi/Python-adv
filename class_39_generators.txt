Generator:-
--------

Generator is a function which is responsible to generate a sequence of values.
We can write generator function like odinary function, But it use yield word to return the values.

It's return the value one by one so here we can use next() function

def calculator(a,b):
    sum = a+b
    sub = a-b
    mul = a*b
    div = (a/b)
    yield sum
    yield sub
    yield mul
    yield div

s = calculator(10,20)

print(next(s))
print(next(s))
print(next(s))
print(next(s))

def sequence():
    for i in range(7,10):
        pow = i**2
        yield pow

var = sequence()

---Running Notes

def cal(a,b):
    add = a+b
    return add
first_obj = next(var)
sec_obj = next(var)

print(cal(first_obj,sec_obj))
